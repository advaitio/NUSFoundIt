# NUSFoundIt

Welcome to NUSFoundIt! This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) project created by Kevin Varghese and Advait Phadnis for CP2106 *Orbital* at NUS. It runs natively on [Expo Go](https://expo.dev) but its production web deployment can also be accessed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (which *only* works on **mobile web browsers**). 

## View on Expo Go

### Prerequisites
Before setting up, users/testers must ensure the following is installed on their computer:
- Node.js --> Version 20.x or 22.x LTS recommended
- Git --> for cloning of repository
- Expo Go App --> A compatible release is crucial, specifically SDK 55.x.x. Android users can download the .apk file directly from the [website](http://expo.dev/go), specifically choosing the SDK 55 release. iOS users can install the Expo Go SDK 55 beta through Apple TestFlight. First, install the TestFlight app from the App Store. Then, join the Expo Go beta using this [link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/GZJxxfUU).
